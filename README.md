tic tac toe game created using c program .

Tic-tac-toe  is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

I have designed the C code for this game in which computer will play against player.
